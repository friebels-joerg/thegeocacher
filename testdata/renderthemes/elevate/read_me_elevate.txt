INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENGLISH:
********

OruxMaps:
---------

Direct install:
- Open http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme in a browser on your android device
- Press on "OruxMaps" in the column "Install in Android" below "Downloads" in the "Elevate 3" table
- In OruxMaps use the maps icon in top menu bar and "Mapsforge theme" to choose the map style (Elevate or other variation)
- Use the maps icon and "Tweak mapsforge theme" to choose the map style and (de-)select overlays
- The font size and scale factors are already adjusted to the resolution, an additional multiplicator by the app is probably not necessary

Manual install:
- Please make sure you downloaded "Elevate.zip" (or L/XL/SVG variants, for those the installation is analogous)
- If it's an update of existing Elevate map styles: remove all old files and folders
- Unzip Elevate.zip with an Android file explorer to "../oruxmaps/mapstyles/" on your SD-Card or internal memory (depending on your device)
- You can choose your own path for styles in OruxMaps via "Menu", "Global settings", "Maps", "Mapsforge settings" and "Mapsforge themes"
- In OruxMaps use the maps icon in top menu bar and "Mapsforge theme" to choose the map style (Elevate or other variation)
- Use the maps icon and "Tweak mapsforge theme" to choose the map style and (de-)select overlays
